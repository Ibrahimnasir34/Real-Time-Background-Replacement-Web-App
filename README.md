# Real-Time-Background-Replacement-Web-App
**Project Overview**<br>
Welcome to my Real-Time Background Replacement Web App! This project uses OpenCV and Flask to enable real-time video background replacement. You can upload your own background images and see the magic happen instantly! Flask-SocketIO ensures seamless real-time communication between the server and the client.<br>

**Key Features**<br>
**Live Video Feed:** Captures video from your webcam and processes it in real-time.<br>
**Background Replacement:** Uses the SelfiSegmentation module from cvzone to replace the background with any uploaded image.<br>
**User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for uploading background images and viewing the live video feed.<br>
**Real-Time Updates:** Utilizes Flask-SocketIO to provide real-time updates and a smooth user experience.<br>

**Technologies Used**<br>
**Python:** Core programming language for backend processing.<br>
**Flask:** Lightweight web framework for building the web app.<br>
**OpenCV:** For video capture and image processing.<br>
**cvzone:** For easy background segmentation.<br>
**Socket.IO:** For real-time bidirectional communication between the client and server.<br>
**HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For the front-end interface.<br>
